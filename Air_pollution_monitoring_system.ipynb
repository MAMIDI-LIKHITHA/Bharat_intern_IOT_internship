        "The MQ135 sensor can sense NH3, NOx, alcohol, Benzene, smoke, CO2 and some other gases, so it is perfect gas sensor for our Air Quality Monitoring Project. When we will connect it to Arduino then it will sense the gases, and we will get the Pollution level in PPM (parts per million). MQ135 gas sensor gives the output in form of voltage levels and we need to convert it into PPM. So for converting the output in PPM, here we have used a library for MQ135 sensor, it is explained in detail in “Code Explanation” section below."

When it exceeds the limit of 1000 PPM, then it starts cause Headaches, sleepiness and stagnant, stale, stuffy air and if exceeds beyond 2000 PPM then it can cause increased heart rate and many other diseases."
